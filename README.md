# 🚀 Switch 2 Countdown — React Edition

Convert the vanilla‑JS timer from  
<https://github.com/TTPR-LaGuardia-Community-College/js-lab-switch2-countdown-ttpr>  
into a **state‑driven React app** that shows off the component life‑cycle.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

| Goal | You will … |
|------|------------|
| **State** | Store changing data with `useState` and trigger re‑renders. |
| **Lifecycle** | Start a “tick” when the component mounts, and stop it when it unmounts (`useEffect`). |
| **Props** | Feed the launch date as a prop instead of hard‑coding. |
| **Declarative UI** | Swap to “Switch 2 is out! 🎉” by changing state, not the DOM. |
| **Stretch** | Play a sound and/or run multiple timers without copy‑pasting logic. |

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. **Clone** the original repo (for reference only).  
2. **Scaffold** a fresh React project:

   ```bash
   // Inside Repo
   npm create vite@latest switch2-react -- --template react
   cd switch2-react
   npm install
  ```
